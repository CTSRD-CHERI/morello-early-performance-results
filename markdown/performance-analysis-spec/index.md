# Performance analysis of SPECint 2006

In this work, we analyze the behavior of the SPECint benchmarks that compile
and run without modification for the CheriBSD pure-capability CheriABI process
environment.
All benchmarks are executed on an FPGA-based Morello implementation using
identical core counts, cache configurations, and microarchitecturally
identical to that in Morello except as otherwise noted.
