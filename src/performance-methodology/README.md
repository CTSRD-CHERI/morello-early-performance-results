# Performance methodology

In the following section, we explore the following as understood at the time
of writing:

* Meaningful software comparisons (e.g., 64-bit aarch64 vs pure-capability
  aarch64c, OSes, etc)
* Known limitations of the Morello processor design and SoC, as well as the
  data-dependency fix used in our measurements
* Known limitations of the Morello software stack including ABIs and toolchain
