# Headline results

In this section, we summarise high-level Morello programme results with
respect to [architectural integration](architectural-integration.md),
[software ecosystem enablement](software-ecosystem-enablement.md),
[microarchitectural objectives](microarchitectural-objectives.md), and
[dynamic performance](dynamic-performance.md).

More detailed explorations of the performance framework and performance
analysis results can be found in later sections [Performance
methodology](../performance-methodology/) and [Performance analysis of SPECint
2006)](../performance-analysis-spec/).
